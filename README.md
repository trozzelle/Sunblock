### Sunblock - Bluesky auto-mute/blocker

This is a short script that will read through your followers and mute anyone who is following greater than the number 
you set in the .env file. One Bluesky implements blocking, the script will be updated to include auto-blocking.

You can schedule the script by running `node scheduler.js`. Currently it is set to execute every hour.
